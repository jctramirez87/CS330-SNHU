**How do I approach designing software?**<br/>

*What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?*<br/>
Working on my project has refined several key design skills. I have developed modular design thinking, allowing me to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components, making the system more organized and maintainable. Additionally, I have gained a strong awareness of optimization, balancing performance with readability and maintainability to ensure efficient code execution. User interaction considerations have also been a significant focus, as I worked on improving control schemes and input handling to enhance the overall user experience. Lastly, my understanding of mathematical and geometric concepts has deepened, particularly in 3D graphics, where transformations, camera systems, and shading play a crucial role in rendering realistic and dynamic scenes.<br/>

*What design process did you follow for your project work?*<br/>
For my project, I followed a structured design process by first capturing a photo of the objects I wanted to recreate in a 3D rendering space. This provided a visual reference to guide my modeling and design decisions. Instead of attempting to complete the entire project at once, I broke it down into smaller segments, incorporating techniques I learned each week. This iterative approach allowed me to gradually refine my work while ensuring that each stage aligned with my growing skill set.<br/>

*How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?*<br/>
My design approach is adaptable to future projects with complex environments, as breaking the project into smaller, manageable components allows me to maintain control and concentrate on each aspect individually.<br/>

**How do I approach developing programs?**<br/>
*What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?*<br/>
While developing my 3D scene, I adopted a new strategy of visualizing the scene before capturing a reference photo and continuously imagining how to transform those objects into a 3D environment. I dedicated significant time to experimenting with the placement of shapes, as well as refining textures and lighting for each object.<br/>

*How did iteration factor into your development?*<br/>
Iteration was a key part of my development process. I continuously adjusted object transformations and lighting parameters to enhance visual realism, gradually refining the overall appearance of the scene.<br/>

*How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?*<br/>
Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code has evolved significantly, leading to the project's completion. Initially, I focused on understanding the fundamental requirements and structuring my code in a way that met those needs. As the project progressed, I adopted a more iterative approach, breaking down tasks into smaller components and refining them through continuous testing and debugging. 
I also improved my ability to write modular and reusable code, ensuring better maintainability and scalability. Incorporating feedback and testing at each stage helped me identify and resolve issues early, leading to more efficient development. By the final milestone, I had developed a structured workflow that emphasized clarity, correctness, and optimization, ultimately enabling me to deliver a well-functioning and polished final product.<br/>

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**<br/>
*How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?*
Studying computational graphics and visualizations has deepened my understanding of 3D environments, which are crucial in fields like game development and simulations. These skills will be invaluable as I continue my education and explore advanced graphics programming.<br/>

*How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?*<br/>
The ability to generate visual representations through computational graphics enhances my skill set as a software engineer. These skills are essential in industries that rely on visualization, simulation, or immersive interfaces, including VR, AR, and architectural visualization.<br/>
